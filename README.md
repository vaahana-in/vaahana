## Tech Stack

- **MERN**: We're all about MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. But here’s the twist - we use Next.js instead of plain React for that extra oomph in server-side rendering and SEO benefits.
- **Next.js**: Supercharges our React game, giving us faster page loads, static exporting, and more.
- **MongoDB**: Our data storage hero, handling all our data needs flexibly.
- **Express.js and Node.js**: The backbone of our server-side, keeping things running smoothly.
