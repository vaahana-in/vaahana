# Contributing to Vaahana

üèçÔ∏è Welcome to the Vaahana family! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to our peer-to-peer motorbike sharing platform. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving our documentation, every contribution is valuable.

## Before You Start

- **Check Existing Pull Requests**: Before starting your work, take a look at existing pull requests. Someone might already be working on something similar.
- **Review GitHub Projects**: Our GitHub Projects section is a goldmine! It's where you'll find planned features, ongoing work, and ideas for future improvements. This can help you see where you can contribute best.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Vaahana repository on GitHub. This creates a copy for you to work on.
2. **Create a Branch**: Make a new branch in your forked repo for your changes. It's best to keep your branch focused on a single feature or fix.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Jump into the code and make your magic happen. Remember to adhere to our coding standards and write clean, readable code.
4. **Test Your Changes**: Make sure your changes don't break anything. We love new features, but not at the cost of stability!
5. **Write or Update Documentation**: If you're adding a new feature, include documentation. If you're fixing a bug, check if the documentation needs updating.
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're happy with your changes, submit a pull request to the main Vaahana repository. Provide a clear description of what your changes do and why they are needed.

## Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style. Consistency is key!
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages. This helps others understand the history of the project.
- **Issues and Bugs**: If you find issues or bugs, report them with clear, detailed instructions on how to reproduce the problem.

## Community and Conduct

- **Be Respectful**: We're a diverse community of enthusiasts and developers. Respect and kindness go a long way.
- **Ask Questions**: Not sure about something? Just ask! We're here to help each other.
